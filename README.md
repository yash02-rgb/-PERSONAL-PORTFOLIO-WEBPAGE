# DESCRIPTION: Personal Portfolio Webpage
The goal of this task was to build a Personal Portfolio Website using only HTML and CSS. This type of website is meant to represent an individual online, especially a developer, where they can share details about themselves, show off their projects, and provide a way for others to contact them.

As part of the task, I created a responsive single-page website, which means that all the content is on one page, and it adjusts well on different screen sizes like mobile phones, tablets, and desktops. The design includes a navigation menu at the top that links to different sections of the page, like Home, About Me, Projects, and Contact. When someone clicks on a link, the page smoothly scrolls down to that section.

In the About Me section, I added a short introduction, like who I am, what I do, and maybe a few skills I have. The Projects section is used to list out a few example projects I’ve worked on, with a short description for each. The Contact section includes my email or any other basic contact info.

I used only HTML and CSS to build the structure and style of the website. I didn’t use any JavaScript or outside libraries because the task was focused on understanding the basics and keeping it simple. CSS was used for layout, fonts, colors, and making sure the website looks neat and is easy to read. I also added some basic responsiveness using CSS media queries to make sure it works on smaller screens.

The main objective was not to create something super advanced but to show that I can build a clean, simple, and functional portfolio website from scratch. This task helped me understand how real-life portfolios are built, and it’s a good starting point for learning how to represent myself online as a developer.
